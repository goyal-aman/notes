                <p>Having a second brain is about offloading information from brain to a commonplace. When need arise in future information can be referred from commonplace without relying on brain to remember every single detail which is a tiring process.</p><p>Building second brain has four main steps having acronym CODE</p><ol><li>C for Capture:<ul><li>capture not too much and not too little. Too much information is no better than reading entire thing and overwhelm the future brain.</li><li>There are four main capture criteria<ul><li>U for Useful: Capture whats is useful</li><li>P for Personal: Capture personal thoughts, ideas, memories.</li><li>I for Inspiring: Capture what inspire you</li><li>S for Surprising: Capture what is surprising for you.</li></ul></li><li>For every resource you want to capture, add a link to original source. And add essence of the material which is no longer than few sentences.</li></ul></li><li>O for Organize:<ul><li>Don't spend all the time in organizing. Perfectly organized notes is not the goal.</li><li>Investigating too much time in organizing is waste since eventually things will need to change with your changing needs.</li><li>Use PARA technique to organize materials.</li><li>P.A.R.A means Projects, Area, Resources and Archives.</li><li>Projects are goals which have clearly defined outcomes and timelines such as Birthday planning, preparing deck.</li><li>Area are goals which don’t have any clear end and outcomes but have your active interest such as Health, Finance.</li><li>Resources are stuff you are interested but don’t need use immediately.</li><li>Archives contains anything of previous three which don’t have any need.</li></ul></li><li>D for Distil:<ol><li>Distillation is notes is keeping only parts of content and stripping away most to make sure things are approachable in future</li><li>Use progressive highlighting to mark important parts.</li><li>Progressive highlighting means - first take a portion of content, then bold some portion from previous step, then highlight some portion from precious step and finally if absolutely needed write executive summary.</li><li>Each step highlight portion more important than before and should be ideally 10-20% of previous steps.</li><li>Problems with beginners in highlighting<ol><li>too much highlighting - highlights are only discoverability points, when required original source can be referred.</li><li>highlighting without purpose- don’t highlight when you are saving and organizing but highlight when you know how you will use that note.</li><li>Making it harder to highlight- don’t analyze too much to decide whether to highlight or not. Believe your instincts.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>E for Express:<ol><li>Express Stage Defined: This is the stage where you turn your organized notes and ideas into tangible outputs, such as articles, presentations, or projects.</li><li>Focus on Progress, Not Perfection: The goal is not to produce perfect work but to create momentum and refine over time.</li><li>Start Small: Begin by sharing drafts, outlines, or sketches instead of waiting for a fully polished product.</li><li>Reuse&nbsp; and Remix Ideas: Use the content and insights you’ve already captured and organized in earlier stages of the PARA system (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives).</li><li>Capture Insights from Everywhere: Don’t restrict your inspiration to your formal notes—draw from everyday experiences, conversations, and random thoughts.</li><li>Actionable Knowledge: Expressing helps clarify your thoughts and turn passive knowledge into actionable insights.</li><li>Iterative Process: Treat creation as an iterative process. Share early, get feedback, and improve gradually.</li><li>Value of Sharing: Sharing what you create (even in draft form) can lead to unexpected opportunities, collaboration, or insights from others.</li><li>Creative Momentum: Regularly expressing your ideas reinforces creativity, builds confidence, and makes the next expression easier.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Once you have second brain in place and a system that keep it relevant, comes the next step - execution.</p><ul><li>Convergence Divergence</li></ul><p>Strategies of getting creative projects done</p><ol><li>The archipelago of ideas - giving your self stepping stones: archipelago of ideas is the groups of ideas gathered during exploration phase of project. Use these series of ideas to switch to creative mode and link them to create a first deliverable.</li><li>The Hemingway bridge - use todays moment tomorrow: at the end of current work session spare some time at the end when you still have energy to note down the instructions for your future self. Such as where to start, whats going on currently in your mind, ideas of where story can go and how to proceed.</li><li>Dial down the scope: when the requirements bloons to something that is too much to handle and deliver; narrow down the scope and deliver something small. Always focus on delivering something and don’t wait to&nbsp; deliver something perfect.</li></ol>
